# **Vcpkg**

C/C++ dependency manager from Microsoft
For all platforms, buildsystems, and workflows

# Basic usage

```shell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cd vcpkg
bootstrap-vcpkg

```
```shell
vcpkg search fmt

fmt  8.1.1#1   Formatting library for C++. It can be used as a safe alternative to printf...

Elapsed time for package fmt:x64-linux: 8.324 s

Total elapsed time: 15.6 s

The package fmt provides CMake targets:

    find_package(fmt CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE fmt::fmt)

# Behind the scenes

- Each package is defined as portfile in `vcpkg/ports/<portname>/portfile.cmake`
    - E.g. [vcpkg/ports/fmt/portfile.cmake](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/ports/fmt/portfile.cmake) 
- Each portfile is normally build up the same
    1. Download the sources
    2. Configure the build tool. E.g. cmake or even msbuild, bazel...
    3. Build the package from sources
    4. If build succeed, place 
      - the bin/lib in `vcpkg/installed/<arch>/bin` or `<arch>/lib`
      - place the headers in `<arch>/include`

# Integrate vcpkg to your C/C++ project

- Place a `vcpkg.json` into your project root
```json
{
  "name": "vcpkg-hello",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "dependencies": [
	"fmt"
  ]
}
```
- Run `vcpkg install` will find the dependencies specified in `vcpkg.json` and install them

---

# Integrate vcpkg to the build

- Vcpkg fits quite well in the cmake build process


```shell
# Configure it, will initiate also the vcpkg bootstrapping
cmake -B <build_dir> -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<path to vcpkg>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

# Build the actual project
cmake --build <build_dir>
```
- Using `vcpkg` as git submodule, you even don't have to pass `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` to the cmake invocation.

```cmake
set(CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
  CACHE STRING "Vcpkg toolchain file")
```
